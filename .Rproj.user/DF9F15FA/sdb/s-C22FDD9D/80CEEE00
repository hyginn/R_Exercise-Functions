Execute code by selecting it and typing <cmd><enter>. Edit it\n#  as required, experiment and play. DO NOT simply source() this whole\n#  file! If there are portions you don't understand, use R's help\n#  system, google for an answer, or ask me. Don't continue if you\n#  don't understand what's going on. That's not how it works ...\n#\n# ====================================================================\n\n\" Introduction:\n  ...\n\"\n\n\n# ====================================================================\n#        PART ONE: REVIEW\n# ====================================================================\n\n\n\n\n# == SECTION =========================================================\n\n\n# == Subsection\n\n# Continue ...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# ====================================================================\n#        APPENDIX: OUTLOOK\n# ====================================================================\n\"There are many more functions for ... that this tutorial did not cover. You should know about the following. Look up the function and write a short bit of example code that uses it:\"\n\n?subset\n?sweep\n?with     # ... and within()\n\n\"Then you should know about the following packages. Open the vignette and browse through it. You should know be able to come up with least one use-case where the package functions would be useful:\n\n   https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/magrittr/\n\"\n\n\n\n\n# [END]\n",
